Computer randomly selects a letter.

Letter gets stored in variable. > Computer's Choice

User is asked in directions to guess what letter the
computer is thinking of.

User presses a letter on keyboard.

For every key press that is a letter, 
	If your guess is correct (your guess matches Computer's Choice):
		Alert User of making correct choice (My add-in).
		Add 1 to Wins.
		Erase everything from Your Guesses So Far.*
		Make computer choose a new letter.*

	Else your guess is wrong (your guess does NOT match Computer's Choice):
		Guesses Left is reduced by 1.
		Your guess is added to Your Guesses So Far.

		If Guesses Left = 0:
			Alert User of losing and tell the User what the correct letter was (My add-in).
			Add 1 to Losses.
			Erase evyerthing from Your Guesses So Far.*
			Make computer choose new letter. *


*I can probably make a function just for these two
steps since I'm repeating the same thing.
