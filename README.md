This repository is for homework assignment #3 for UA Coding Bootcamp.
I chose to do the Psychic Game. For this, we were to build a game 
using JavaScript where the computer generates a random letter, a through z, 
and the user has 9 chances to guess that letter. Each time the user guesses
a letter correctly, their win count increases by one. If they fail to 
guess the correct letter in 9 tries, their losses count increases by one.
Each time the user wins or loses, the game is reset without reloading the
page. We were free to style the game's appearance however we wanted. 

The due date for this assignment was Saturday, August 5, 2017.
