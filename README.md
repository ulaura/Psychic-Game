# Light Bulb Psychic Game
This repository is for homework assignment #3 for UA Coding Bootcamp.
There were two options for this assignment. I chose to make a psychic game.
The original due date was Saturday, August 5, 2017.

## About
This game was built with regular JavaScript.

It's hosted online. It can be played on the browser [here](https://ulaura.github.io/Psychic-Game/).

**NOTE:** This game can only be played with a desktop or a laptop. Mobile use is currently unavailable. 

## Instructions
The computer will randomly choose a letter from the alphabet. 
The goal is for the user to guess that letter by pressing a key on the keyboard. 

The user is allowed 9 chances to guess the correct letter. 
The game will display each incorrect guess the user makes.

The game will prevent the user from making any guesses that aren't letters a - z.
The game will also prevent the user from repeating previous guesses. 
Neither of these mistakes will count as one of the user's 9 chances. 

Each time the user guesses a letter correctly, their win count increases by one, and the screen will light up with a surprise image.
If they fail to guess the correct letter in 9 chances, their losses count increases by one.

Each time the user wins or loses, the game will restart without reloading the page.
